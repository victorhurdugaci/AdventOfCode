# Advent of Code 2016 (Solutions in Haskell) - ~~Work in Progress~~ Never finished

My solutions for the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).

- All solutions are written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).
- I'm learning Haskell as I solve the problems. You might see improvements in code as I progress through the month.
- Sorry, got sidetracked and never finished all days
