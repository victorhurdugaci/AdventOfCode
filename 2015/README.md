# Advent of Code 2015 (Solutions in Go)

My solutions for the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).

- All solutions are written in [Go](https://golang.org/).
- I learned Go as I was going through the puzzles. You might notice my progress as I discovered new language features.
- Some solutions have tests.
- Some solutions are just brute force algorithms.
- My favorite puzzle was Day 23, followed Day 22.
- The most challenging puzzle was Day 24. The difficult part is finding a solution that runs in a reasonable amount of time. Naive brute force will not work.
